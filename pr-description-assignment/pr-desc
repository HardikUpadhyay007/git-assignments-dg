# PR Title
**feat/FEAPP-420: Enable Customer Notifications via WhatsApp**

# PR Description

## Whatâ€™s New

This pull request adds support for notifying customers about product listing updates through WhatsApp. The main changes are:

### Frontend
- Enhanced customer preferences UI with an optional WhatsApp number input field.
- Added validation for WhatsApp numbers.
- Updated form submission logic to send the WhatsApp number to the backend only if provided.

### Backend
- Extended the customer model to include an optional `whatsapp_number` field.
- Integrated WhatsApp messaging using the Twilio API.

### Other Updates
- Updated environment configuration to include Twilio credentials (managed securely via `.env`).
- Added a utility module for formatting and validating WhatsApp numbers.
- Introduced the Twilio SDK as a new dependency.

## Why This Change

Customers have requested more convenient notification channels. While email remains the default, WhatsApp is preferred by many users for its accessibility and speed, especially internationally.

This feature, requested in ticket **FEAPP-420**, supports our roadmap to improve customer communication flexibility. By making WhatsApp notifications optional, we aim to:
- Increase user engagement
- Reduce missed updates
- Offer a more personalized experience

## Notes

- The WhatsApp number field is optional; existing users are unaffected if they do not provide it.
- Please run `npm install` after pulling this branch to install the new Twilio SDK dependency.
